# Release Notes
## V0.2
- Transformations of GIS variables (mostly sqrt)
- Machine Learning in mlr3 framework: 
  - Testing prediction quality of GIS_vars → Mediators → PRS_vars
    - comparing performances + inference
  - Linear models, Random Forests, XGBoost (with parameter tuning)
- Improved code structure by separating data preparation, machine learning, and hypothesis testing
- Hypothethis testing:
  1. Train data X imputation using MissForest (simplified approach as uncertainties not needed for feature selection)
  2. Feature selection based on correlation/VIF analysis
  3. Feature selection implemented due to high VIF
  4. Additionally inspecting all interactions


## V0.1
- Initial release (Technical Setup)
- Data Preparation
  - Conducted sanity checks on data (duplications, type consistency, comparison with `df_varlookup_for_lukas.xlsx`)
  - Performed type encoding
  - Created 14 dictionaries for translating ordinal categorical variables to numeric (e.g., Very:5, Quite:4, Fair:3, Little:2, Not:1)
- Filtered observations according to criteria in `_INFO_for_Lukas.docx`
- Missing Values
  - Checked patterns of missingness for PRS-Variables, Mediators, and GIS-Variables
  - For PRS-Variables: Compared imputation methods (MissForest, column-wise mean, observation-wise mean)
  - Imputed missing values using MissForest (each chunk separately) - to be done separately for train/test data
- Initial modeling completed - results to be updated with imputed data and PC1-4

# Data Preparation

# Main Analysis

### Response Variable Selection
Initial approach:
- Aggregated MEAN
- LA (Fascination)
- BA (Being Away)
- EC (Extent Coherence)
- ES (Compatibility)

**PCA Verification** of this approach. Key findings:

- Data can be well approximated with 3-4 dimensions
- First dimension is close to weighted average of all variables (correlation >0.99)
- EC (Extent Coherence) shows most divergence (see PC2)
- LA (Fascination) and BA (Being Away) show similarity (see PC1-PC3)
- Aggregated PRS variables justified by PCA results (similar rotation values), supporting use of mean

PCA projections will be further investigated as alternative response variables (alongside LA-4).

## Prediction Analysis
Details in [the notebook](notebooks/mlr3.qmd).

Following RESTORE project approach, investigating links between PRS, Mediators, and GIS variables using:
- Linear Models
- XGBoost (with trees + parameter tuning)
- Random Forests

Evaluation: Percentage of explained variance on hold-out data. Missing values imputed with MissForest (no p-values → no assumptions needed).

### Results
- GIS shows limited predictive power for PRS on ES (5% variance explained)
- GIS + Mediators explain 25% of PRS variance
- Mediators alone explain majority of PRS variance
  - GIS primarily helps with ES through tree-based methods
  - Suggests GIS effect is more interaction-based than direct
  - Similar reduction in tree-based methods observed in BA

## Hypothesis Testing
Details in [the notebook](notebooks/hypothethis-tests.qmd).

Process:
1. Train data X imputation using MissForest (simplified approach as uncertainties not needed for feature selection)
2. Feature selection based on correlation/VIF analysis
3. Feature selection implemented due to high VIF

### Results
- Continuous mediator outperforms categorical (scaled to mean 0, sd 1)
- HM_NOISELVL not significant (pre-p-adjustment)
- Full `mice` NA-handling likely unnecessary
  - Models use few variables
  - Only LNOISE shows high NA count
  - Information detection still fails
- Significant edges remain in SEM (see all interactions)
