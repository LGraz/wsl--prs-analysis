## Prediction analysis
I left it as-is. Without changing the mediators. Removing most mediators would make the ML-models struggle a lot.

## Plotting Themes
Color palettes and themes can be adjusted. Feel free to chose one:
- Themes: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
- Pallets: https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-colour.html#brewer-scales

In case you are not familiar with GitHub + Quarto, feel free to contact me. I can help you to set it up, and show you how to modify the plots in the most sustainable/efficient way.



# V1.4
- [x] removed "In general"
- [x] Implemented comments from email-attachement
  - Comment: Initially I used HM_noise since you were looking at those HM_Noise-groups (in the big table we replaced with this plot)
  - Implementing the fixed scaling does not change much for plot "Sound_Type" or "Attribute," but only in "Annoyance". There you nicely see the annoyance of "Road Traffic". Only the very slight increase of low-annoyance levels is hidden.
  - The y label now includes the range. e.g. "[0-10]"
- "I think it is enough to mention HM Noise only in the plots HMâ€“RL for NDVI and noise level. They illustrate that people living at noisy places are s well unprivileged with available RLs."
  - Please explain what I should do here. You just say that the NDVI-version is less interesting. Or do you want me to switch the x/y axis (right now x-axis is HM_ which is nice to answer questions of the type, do high-HM_ participants have good restorative locations)?
